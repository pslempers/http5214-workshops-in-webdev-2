Humber Polytechnic Web Development Semester 2

Class files and exercises from Workshops in Web Development 2.

This course will allow students to access additional support for content delivered in the other classes each semester. Every student in the class will engage in a process of self-assessment to help them identify areas where they would benefit from help, and then the student and teaching team will set up a process for providing support for any areas where the student would benefit from some in-the-moment support. Mentors, tutors and workshops will be available.
